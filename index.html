        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi friends! My name is Lauren, and I am from Denver, CO. I attended college at Baylor University where I majored in French and minored in entrepreneurship. After college, I became a flight attendant and have had so much fun traveling the world, meeting new people, and learning about other cultures. I am looking forward to keeping my feet on the ground and seeing what this next chapter has in store for me. </p>
